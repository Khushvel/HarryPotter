    <p>Hi my name is Khushvel . Tomorrow i am gonning for a walk , do some exercise and then start my day.
        <br>I want to start my day with some reading of books,code then play chess and repeat the things until I 
        finish <br> it soon so I could start new things like finishing the books revision also , start cirriculum
        activities and <br> give much active participation.My name is Khushvel Wade and in 2021 I am studying in 11th
        commerce <br>classes only as the collage (selected in BMCC) has not been started uptill now as the cut-of
        2rd round list<br> is still on.Today was the first lecture of class which was OCM , the last 8th chapter 
        was on from the middle.<br> Pawar sir taught one page from middle in one hour. Basically sir try to distribute
        as much practical knowledge,<br>history and GK . I think their opinion are too biased and hence should not be
        used for giving it to others .<br> Sir pays more attention towards girls . The most special things about the class
        is that they have practical<br> activities to do as we learn them and all the students are closely bonded with their
        teacher . After the<br> lecture sir told that they're goinng to explain core concepts to only little students 
        (3 in count) and all were<br> the girls. In my 10th my 3 subject fees were around 35 thousand per year and my 11th
        tutuion fees are told<br> 10 thousand per year with 4 subjects. Also students told to bring OCM and ecomics book 
        everyday as<br> sir will not start other subjects like accounting for months. I here definately doubt the quality of 
        education<br> provided by our Pawar sir (only sir i the tution). So thats all for the day ,bye!
